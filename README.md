# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is where I’m documenting everything I’m learning about **Requirement Analysis** as part of my software development journey. Requirement analysis is a critical early step in building any software system, and this repo helps me understand how to do it right—from gathering information to validating what users actually need.

## 🧭 Introduction

I created this repository to keep track of what I’ve learned about requirement analysis and to apply it to real scenarios. It includes explanations, notes, and examples based on a case study involving a **booking management project**. The goal is to understand how to capture and define clear, useful software requirements before jumping into design or coding.

## ❓ What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of figuring out **what a system is supposed to do** and making sure that understanding is shared between users, developers, and stakeholders. 

It’s basically about asking the right questions, listening carefully, and writing things down in a way that makes sense. This process helps avoid confusion later and makes sure that the final software actually solves the problem it was meant to.

In the software development lifecycle (SDLC), requirement analysis comes early—right after the idea for a project is proposed. If this step isn’t done well, the rest of the project can go off track pretty quickly.

## 🚀 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Here are a few reasons I’ve found that explain why this step really matters:

1. **Everyone Gets on the Same Page**  
   It helps developers, clients, and project managers understand the goals and features of the system before writing any code.

2. **Prevents Costly Mistakes**  
   It’s easier and cheaper to fix problems in the planning stage than after development has started.

3. **Guides the Whole Project**  
   Clear requirements give direction for design, coding, testing, and even maintenance. Without them, it’s like building a house without a blueprint.

## ⚙️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Here are the five main activities I’m learning to do during requirement analysis:

### 1. Requirement Gathering  
This is when I talk to stakeholders (users, clients, etc.) and collect their ideas, needs, and expectations for the system.

### 2. Requirement Elicitation  
This goes deeper than gathering—it’s about asking the right questions and using techniques like interviews, workshops, and observations to draw out important details.

### 3. Requirement Documentation  
I take everything I’ve learned and write it down clearly, usually in formats like user stories, Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), or use case diagrams.

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling  
This involves organizing the information, finding gaps or conflicts, and modeling how the system should behave. Tools like flowcharts or ER diagrams are helpful here.

### 5. Requirement Validation  
Finally, I check with stakeholders to make sure I got it right. This step helps confirm that the documented requirements are complete and aligned with what they need.

## 🧱 Types of Requirements

Here’s what I learned about the two main categories of requirements, with examples based on a **booking management project** I’m using as a case study.

### 🔹 Functional Requirements

These describe **what the system should do**—its main features and functions.

**Examples:**
- Users can make, edit, and cancel bookings.
- The system should send confirmation emails after each successful booking.
- Admin users can manage available booking slots.
- Users must log in to access their booking history.

### 🔸 Non-functional Requirements

These describe **how the system should perform** or behave under certain conditions.

**Examples:**
- The system must respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- It should support up to 1,000 users making bookings at the same time.
- User data should be stored securely using encryption.
- The booking system should have 99.9% uptime over a year.
